# Resolver

Resolver is a swift package that handles all the core logic of the Streamer iOS and tvOS app. It's responsible for parsing the website's HTML to output a raw URL that can be used to play the media content. 

## Common terms:
- Provider: a website that contains movies or TV shows like 123moviesfree.so
- Media Content: Any content that contains playable material. it can be a movie or TV show
- Source: 3rd party websites that host the video content like streamtape.com
- Stream: contains information about playable content. it contains raw URL and headers used to play this content on any player
- Resolver: a piece of code that converts a source "URL from a provider" to a stream "URL used to play content on any player"

## Installation 
- Clone the repo
- open `SampleApp/SampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14
- Run the project
- You should see a sample app running the playground that shows content from one provider. The provider is defined in `SampleApp.swift` 


## Writing your own provider 
- open `SampleApp/SampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14
- Browse the `Resolver` pacakge to `Sources/Resolver/Providers`
- Open `Provider.swift` and add a new case to the `ProviderType` enum with the provider name e.g `case xyz`
- Create a new file with the provider name in the providers folder e.g `XYZProvider.swift`
- Create a new struct that conforms to the `Provider` protocol e.g 
```
struct XYZProvider: Provider {
    var type: ProviderType = .xyz

    // Name of the website
    var title: String = "XYZProvider"

    // Emoji for the website langauge
    var langauge: String = "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"

    // Description of the content on the website
    var subtitle: String = "English content"

    // The base URL for the website
    var baseURL: URL = URL(staticString:"https://xyz.com")

    // The base URL that contains all the movie listing
    var moviesURL: URL = URL(staticString:"https://xyz.com/movies")

    // The base URL that contains all the TV shows listing
    var tvShowsURL: URL = URL(staticString:"https://xyz.com/tvshows")

    func latestMovies(page: Int) async throws -> [MediaContent] {

        // Write code to request and parse a specific page for movie listing
        return []
    }

    func latestTVShows(page: Int) async throws -> [MediaContent] {
        // Write code to request and parse a specific page for a TV show listing
    }

    func fetchMovieDetails(for url: URL) async throws -> Movie {
        // Write code to request and parse specific movie details

    }

    func fetchTVShowDetails(for url: URL) async throws -> TVshow {
        // Write code to request and parse specific tv show details
    }

    func search(keyword: String, page: Int) async throws -> [MediaContent] {
        // Write code to request and parse a search query for this website
    }
}

```
- You can always check the older providers for guidance
- You can write a test case in the resolver tests target to verify your implementation or you can use the playground to check the output

## Writing your own resolver 
- open `SampleApp/SampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14
- Browse the `Resolver` pacakge to `Sources/Resolver/Resolvers/Hosts`
- Create a new file with the resolver name in the providers folder e.g `XYZResolver.swift`
- Create a new struct that conforms to the `Resolver` protocol e.g 
```
struct XYZResolver: Resolver {
    // List of domains supported by this resolver
    static var domains: [String] = [""]

    // request and parse the URL to generate streams. some resolvers can generate multiple streams for multiple qualities 
    func getMediaURL(url: URL) async throws -> [Stream] {

    }
}
```
- Open `Resolver.swift` and add your resolver to `HostsResolver.resolvers` array 
- You can always check the older resolvers for guidance
- You can write a test case in the resolver tests target to verify your implementation or you can use the playground to check the output


## What happens next? 

- Once a new provider/resolver is merged to main a CI job will be triggered to build the app and attach the ipa files for both iOS and tvOS in the artifacts section
- It will be automatically included in the next release of Streamer App
